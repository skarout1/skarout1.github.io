                <h3>My Remarks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Design:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I really like the design and layout of the webpage. It is really simple and elegant</li>
                            <li>The contrast between the color choices is good</li>
                            <li>The Green color is easy on the eyes</li>
                            <li>The font is uniform and again a good professional looking choice</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Layout:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The layout of the page is also simple and easy to navigate</li>
                            <li>There is are clear header and main elements to help with this</li>
                            <li>There however is not a clear footer. There is an "all rights reserved" at the bottum, but it just sits there. Not seperate from the rest of the page at all</li>
                            <li>There are clear and easy to find links in the header leading to the different pages on the site</li>
                            <li>The company name is cleary posted</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Content:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The content of the page leaves a lot to be desired</li>
                            <li>There is very little to no genuine contetn on the actual page to tell the visitor of the site anything about the client</li>
                            <li>The golfing photos throughout the page are a nice touch</li>
                            <li>There is not much else to say because of the lack of content</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Interactive Element:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a small link to google maps on the contact map that shows the client office. I think this is a nice touch and interactive for the user of the webpage</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Requirements:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The page does meet most of the requirments for the client project, but does not go above and beyond</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
