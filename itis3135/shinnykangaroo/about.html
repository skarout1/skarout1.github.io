        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="about">
            We here at ShinnyKangaroo Industries believe in the free sharing of knowledge and wisdom. 
            We have noticed the massive increase in the number of servers/data centres being built and whether they are for AI or not, they can be pricy. 
            Because of this we are working to build our own data centres and design our own software for said data centres. 
            But we do so not with the intention of selling server space to larger corperations, but to you, the individual. 
            We want to do so for a cheaper and reasonable price. Allowing you affordable and easy access to reliable and fast cloud servers.
