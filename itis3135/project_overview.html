                <p>
                    The purpose of this website will be to present AgenticArc to clients. The clients can surf through the website and understand AgenticArc and what they have to offer.
                    All of AgeticArcs services will be presented openly and clearly as well as some previously worked on projects to work as a sort of portfolio.
                </p>
