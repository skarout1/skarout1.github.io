                <h3>My Remarks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Design:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I like the design and layout of the webpage</li>
                            <li>The contrast between the color choices is not great</li>
                            <li>The Green color is not very easy on rthe easy. The green color of the text clashes with the background a bit</li>
                            <li>The blue colored linkes in the header are a bit hard to read with the green background</li>
                            <li>The font is uniform and again a good professional looking choice</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Layout:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The layout of the page is also simple and easy to navigate</li>
                            <li>There is are clear header and main elements to help with this</li>
                            <li>I would like it more if the images and figcaptions were centered while the p elements were left oriented</li>
                            <li>There are clear and easy to find links in the header leading to the different pages on the site</li>
                            <li>The company name could be larger to make it more obvious who the site is for. It blends in with the other elements</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Content:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The content of the page is strong</li>
                            <li>There are many pictures to help understand the service provided</li>
                            <li>The pictures are not too large either. They do not clash with other elements</li>
                            <li>It is very easy to see that the website is for a jeweler</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Interactive Element:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I almost missed the interactive element</li>
                            <li>It is a simple slideshow presenting a few images of the products offered by the client</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Requirements:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The page does meet most of the requirments for the client project, and goes a little more in depth than required</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
