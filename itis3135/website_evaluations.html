                    <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></h3>
                    <p>You might be thinking that it is a bold idea to go after The Amazon.com a critique them. But I will show you where I am coming from.
                        amazon.com is an E-commerce website that sells millions of differnt products from thousands if not millions of different sells. 
                        They do this well, but what they don't do is make the webpage very east to navigate. It is cluttered, and difficult on the eyes.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Contrast:</b><br>
                            Because of all of the differnt ads and products being presented to the user, the contrast of all the differnt colors is awful.
                            You open the page and are hit with tons of colors bouncing off one another and overlapping.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Repetition:</b><br>
                            The website is fairly repeptitive from page to page. The issue here is that Amazon prime video is a very popular webpage, and they do not make it east at all to find.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>ALignment:</b><br>
                            Again because of all of the ads and different products, nothing at all is aligned. it make shte website an eyesore to look at.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Proximity:</b><br>
                            Not to beat a dead horse, but again these ads are awful. The proximity from one element to another is atrocious. 
                            Things over lap and leave almost no room between them if any.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        My good website is actually google.com. I know this is a little basic but hear me out. Google is used by millions of people everyday.
                        They are a web browser helping its users get from point A to point B. The website is far more simple which allows it to follow the C.R.A.P prinecpals better.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Contrast:</b><br>
                            Google has very little going on on their main webpage. There is little color which allows for very little overlap and contrasting issues.
                            Having an all white background is great for this. Making the entire website easy on the eyes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Repetition:</b><br>
                           Every single google search that you make looks almost identital. This is really great. The different webpages are very repetitive and make it really easy for the user to know where they are at all times.
                        <li>
                            <b>ALignment:</b><br>
                            Again the simplicity here is helpful. The main google page is center aligneed. leaving a big text box to find and use.
                            When a search is made the results tend to be left aligned, makign them also easy to navigate and find what you want.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Proximity:</b><br>
                            There tend to be so few elements on googles website that the proximity from one to another is never really an issue.
                            Things rarley overlap.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
